The first Russian settlements within the boundaries of modern Yekaterinburg appeared in the second half of the 17th century — in 1672, an Old Believers village arose in the area of Shartash lake[27] (this fact is disputed by historians, since no evidence of the founding of the village at that time was found in the sources),[28] and in 1680–1682, the villages of Nizhny and Verkhny Uktus appeared on the banks of Uktus River (now the territory of the Chkalovsky district of the city).[29] In 1702, by the initiative of the head of Sibirskiy prikaz Andrew Vinius, the Uktus state ironwork plant was founded near Nizhny Uktus — the first ironworks within the boundaries of modern Yekaterinburg.[30] In 1704, the Shuvakish ironworks was built (now the territory of the Zheleznodorozhny district of the city).[27] With the beginning of active construction of factories in the Urals in the 18th century, relations with their southern neighbors, the Bashkirs, became strained. As a result of the Bashkir raid in 1709, the village of Verkhny Uktus was devastated, all buildings, including the wooden church and chapel, were burned, the residents fled to the protection of the Uktus plant fortifications.[29] On the night of 5 April 1718, a fire destroyed all the factory buildings of the Uktus plant, except for the dam, and the plant was restored only by 1720 under the supervision of Timofey Burtsev.[31] However, the plant did not receive further development due to the lack of water in Uktus river.

In 1720, by decree of Peter I, a delegation led by mining specialist Johann Blüher and statesman Vasily Tatishchev was sent to the Urals.[32] They were entrusted with managing the mining industry, identifying the causes of the collapse and reduction of production at state-owned factories.[32] On 29 December 1720,[32] Tatishchev and Blüher arrive at the Uktus plant, which became their main residence in the Urals. As a result of familiarizing himself with the state of nearby state-owned factories, Tatishchev came to the conclusion that on the basis of these factories, even if they were reconstructed and expanded, it would not be possible to quickly increase the production of iron, and it would be more profitable to build a new large plant. After inspecting the immediate area, together with the commissary of the Uktus plant, Timofey Burtsev, a place rich in ore and forest was chosen on the banks of the more full-flowing Iset River, 7 versts from Uktus.[32] On 6 February 1721, Tatishchev sent a message to the Collegium of Mining, in which he asked permission to begin construction of the plant, with detailed explanations and justification for this project.[32] On 1 March 1721, without waiting for a response from the Collegium, Tatishchev began construction of the new plant,[27] but he failed to convince Collegium, and by the Collegium decree of 10 December 1721, he was removed from the leadership of mining affairs in the Urals.[27] In 1722, by decree of Peter the Great, a mining engineer, Major General Georg Wilhelm de Gennin, was sent to the Urals in place of Tatishchev. Having studied all the circumstances, de Gennin fully supported Tatishchev’s project, and on 12 March 1723, construction of the plant on Iset resumed.[27]
