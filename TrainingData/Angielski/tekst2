Aston Martin presented the DB9, initially designed by Ian Callum and completed by Henrik Fisker, at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2003.[6][7][8] The DB9 was the first car to employ Aston Martin's "vertical/horizontal" (VH) platform and the first production model built at Aston Martin's factory in Gaydon, Warwickshire, England.[9][10][11] At the 2005 Geneva International Motor Show, Aston Martin debuted the Vantage, a sports car designed by Callum and Fisker.[12][13] Built on the VH platform, the Vantage was engineered to compete with the Porsche 911 and other premium sports cars.[14][15] In 2007, Aston Martin began producing the DBS, which succeeded the V12 Vanquish.[16]

At the 2012 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este, Aston Martin presented a concept car called the Project AM310.[17][18] In June 2012 the company announced that the production version of the car would be called the Vanquish,[19][20] resurrecting the name of the 2001â€“2007 model and succeeding the DBS as the company's flagship car.[21][1][22] The Vanquish was shown at several events in 2012: a sneak preview at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July,[23][24] a presentation to a group of guests at the London Film Museum in the same month,[25] and an appearance at the Monterey Car Week in August.[26] Official manufacture of the car began in the same year at Gaydon,[27] which produced the Vanquish until 2018, when it was succeeded by the DBS Superleggera, which also used a V12 engine.[28]
