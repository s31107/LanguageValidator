The second generation of the Aston Martin Vanquish, a grand touring car, was manufactured and marketed by British carmaker Aston Martin between 2012 and 2018. It succeeded the DBS, resurrected the name of the 2001–2007 model, and was available as both a coupe and a convertible, the latter known as the Volante.

Designed by Marek Reichman, Aston Marton presented a concept car called the Project AM310 at the 2012 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este in Lombardy, Italy. The production version was presented at a sneak preview at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July; a presentation to a group of guests at the London Film Museum also in July; and an appearance at the Monterey Car Week in August.

The Vanquish was based on the DB9's architecture, namely the vertical/horizontal platform. Extensively incorporating aluminium in its construction, the Vanquish was assembled in Gaydon, Warwickshire, England.

Aston Martin presented the Vanquish Volante at the 2013 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, with deliveries starting in late 2013. In 2014, the company made minor modifications to the Vanquish's engine performance. A more significantly modified version, called the Vanquish S, was launched in 2016; its Volante version was released the following year. The Vanquish S introduced such updates as increased horsepower and torque, and a new body kit. Aston Martin produced the Vanquish Zagato—a special edition—in various body styles, including a coupe, convertible, shooting brake, and a roadster, the latter dubbed the Speedster.
